# First time compile

The goal of this code is to exercise the toolchain to
compile one of the simplest win32 applications.


## Compile and Link
Start a 32 or 64 bit MSYS2 terminal session, type

make

## Execution

Type:

./run.exe

## Expectations
A basic dialog window should open with a title of "note"
with a bit of silly text in the body and an OK button.

Activate the OK buton to exit the application
